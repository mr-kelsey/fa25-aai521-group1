This schedule outlines weekly tasks for a two-person team working on the image restoration and enhancement project using Hugging Face generative models.



---



\## Week 3: Project Setup and Planning

\- Finalize project scope and enhancement tasks

\- Select dataset(s) and create degraded image variants

\- Set up GitHub repository and initial README



\*\*Assignments\*\*

\- Person A: Draft README and repo structure  

\- Person B: Research Hugging Face models and shortlist datasets



---



\## Week 4: Model Prototyping – Denoising \& Super-Resolution

\- Implement denoising pipeline in Colab

\- Implement super-resolution pipeline in Colab



\*\*Assignments\*\*

\- Person A: Denoising notebook and evaluation  

\- Person B: Super-resolution notebook and evaluation



---



\## Week 5: Model Prototyping – Colorization \& Inpainting

\- Implement colorization pipeline

\- Implement inpainting pipeline



\*\*Assignments\*\*

\- Person A: Colorization notebook and testing  

\- Person B: Inpainting notebook and testing



---



\## Week 6: Integration and UI Development

\- Build unified enhancement pipeline

\- Develop basic UI (Flask or Streamlit)

\- Prepare sample images for testing



\*\*Assignments\*\*

\- Person A: UI for image upload and task selection  

\- Person B: Backend integration of all models



---



\## Week 7: Finalization and Presentation

\- Write APA-style technical report (7–10 pages)

\- Finalize GitHub README and code comments

\- Record and edit video presentation (10–12 minutes)



\*\*Assignments\*\*

\- Person A: Technical report, APA formatting, references  

\- Person B: Video recording, editing, and slide visuals



---



\## Notes

\- Use Git branches for each enhancement task (`denoising`, `superres`, etc.)

\- Share Colab notebooks early and comment inline for reproducibility

\- Allocate time for peer review and presentation rehearsal in Week 7
