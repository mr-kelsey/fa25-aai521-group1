\# AAI-521 Final Team Project Schedule (Extra Credit – Three-Person Team)



This schedule outlines weekly tasks for a three-person team working on the image restoration and enhancement project using Hugging Face generative models.



---



\## Week 3: Project Setup and Planning



\- Finalize project scope and enhancement tasks

\- Select dataset(s) and create degraded image variants

\- Set up GitHub repository and initial README



\*\*Assignments\*\*

\- Person A: Draft initial README and repo structure  ️✅

\- Person B: Research Hugging Face models and shortlist datasets  ️✅

\- Person C: Create degraded image variants and organize dataset folders  ️✅

\## Week 4: Model Prototyping – Denoising \& Super-Resolution



\- Implement denoising pipeline in Colab  

\- Implement super-resolution pipeline in Colab



\*\*Assignments\*\*

\- Person A: Denoising notebook and evaluation  

\- Person B: Super-resolution notebook and evaluation  

\- Person C: Shared preprocessing and visualization utilities for both models  ️✅

\## Week 5: Model Prototyping – Colorization \& Inpainting



\- Implement colorization pipeline  

\- Implement inpainting pipeline



\*\*Assignments\*\*

\- Person A: Colorization notebook and testing  

\- Person B: Inpainting notebook and testing  

\- Person C: Evaluation metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) and visual comparison plots 



---



\## Week 6: Integration and UI Development



\- Build unified enhancement pipeline  

\- Develop basic UI (Flask or Streamlit)  

\- Prepare sample images for testing



\*\*Assignments\*\*

\- Person A: UI for image upload and task selection  

\- Person B: Backend integration of all models  

\- Person C: Pipeline orchestration, sample image prep, and testing harness 



---



\## Week 7: Finalization and Presentation



\- Write APA-style technical report (7–10 pages)  

\- Finalize GitHub README and code comments  

\- Record and edit video presentation (10–12 minutes)



\*\*Assignments\*\*

\- Person A: Technical report, APA formatting, references  

\- Person B: Video recording, editing, and slide visuals  

\- Person C: Final README, code cleanup, and peer review coordination 



---



\## Notes



\- Use Git branches for each enhancement task (`denoising`, `superres`, `colorization`, `inpainting`)

\- Share Colab notebooks early and comment inline for reproducibility

\- Allocate time for peer review and presentation rehearsal in Week 7
